<h2 id="org691bdbe">Preface: My Connection to these Recipes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org691bdbe">
<p>
I was born in Tehran in a big hospital on a snowy day and so, I was born directly into the heart of Persian Culture. It never managed to rub off on me nearly as much as it should have, however. I stayed in the country until I was 7,
which was when me, my mom, and my dad all immigrated to Toronto which brings us here. I have such fond memories back there of fooling around playing imaginary games with my Cousin at my Grandparents&rsquo; house, and of exploring the
mountains and going to restaurants. It brings back memories of people; some of which, I only have memories left of. But the Culture never rubbed off on me as much as it should have. I learned English alongside Farsi since
Kindergarten, and I remember the exact moment I took my seat on the plane to Canada, the first thought that ran through my head was &ldquo;I think I completely forgot how to read Farsi&#x2026;&rdquo; And so it was. Even now, I don&rsquo;t know how to read
or write Farsi, and I know little of how to speak it and my vocabulary is as minimal as can be. Therefore, one of the main things that ties me back to the country I come from is <i>food!</i> My mom blesses me on a daily basis by making me
all the foods from her, and now from my childhood, and it&rsquo;s the main thing I have to relive those days through. It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s normal for me. These recipes are what I&rsquo;m used to, and what I prefer. I don&rsquo;t know a few of the recipes in
this cookbook, and I won&rsquo;t pretend like I&rsquo;ve made all of these and that I&rsquo;m some cooking professional. These are a sample of the flavours from where I come from. Many of them are my favourite flavours, too. Nothing beats Some
Koobideh Kebab on a sunny day just how I like it, and you, my wondrous reader, will now get a glimpse into many of these dishes. I hope I inspire you to try some of them for yourself, and I most certainly hope you find something to
enjoy in this endeavour. Without further ado&#x2026;

<h2 id="org3a42d96">The Equipment You&rsquo;ll Need</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3a42d96">
<p>
There are few recipes in this Cookbook that demand more than the basic things you&rsquo;re likely to already have. Pans, Pots, Bowls, Whisks, Spatulas, Cups, and Sieves, for instance. You will find, however, that some recipes differ in
this sense:
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc8b8a49" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc8b8a49">An extra large Cooking Pot</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc8b8a49">
<p>
<a href="#orgfb42e7b">Aush Reshteh</a> is one food that is served nearly exclusively on festive occasions and, by design, comes in incredibly large quantities. Because of this, you&rsquo;ll want to grab the biggest pot that can still fit on your stove that you
can find. I recall from the one time I was able to see it being made, it was in my Grandparents&rsquo; basement in a pot so big it reached from the floor up to my Uncle&rsquo;s knees, and of course that&rsquo;s <i>comically</i> large and perhaps excessive
so just generally know you&rsquo;ll want to find a bigger than normal brewing pot for Aush Reshteh.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org90952d2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org90952d2">Heat Diffuser</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org90952d2">
<p>
This is technically optional, but is heavily recommended for <a href="#org1cba1da">Khagineh</a>. Heat Diffusers ensure equal distribution of heat in a Pot, and Khagineh is supposed to be made in a very unique manner wherein it&rsquo;s fried inside a pot. Because
of this; for ease of use, a Heat Diffuser is heavily recommended.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf5db0a5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf5db0a5">Skewers and a Grill</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf5db0a5">
<p>
<a href="#org043e797">Kebab Koobideh</a> is supposed to be made on a grill. It&rsquo;s in the name, in fact: <i>Koobideh</i> means Pounded, which refers to the fact that the meat is supposed to be pounded onto the Skewers and then put over a grill. As with Aush, it&rsquo;s
a dish that takes a lot of effort to create authentically, and so is usually reserved for parties and gatherings such as Picnics.

When I was much younger, Fereni was one of my favourite breakfasts/snacks, and I cherished it every time my mom or my grandma made me some. Fereni is nothing more than a fairly simple little Pudding, in truth, but it will always
hold a special place in my heart, and I hope it serves as a convenient light little addition to your breakfast!

<p>
Shir-Berenj (better known as Rice Pudding, or to take the <i>literal</i> translation: Milk-Rice) is an incredibly straightforward and simple food, but serves as a delicious way to start even the worst of mornings. The way I had it
growing up made it simple for my mom to make, but I loved it all the same. I&rsquo;m sure you will too&#x2026; Seeing how it&rsquo;s impossible to not like Rice Pudding! You may notice how it sounds quite similar to<a href="#org481fd38"> Fereni</a> (or maybe that&rsquo;s just
me) but I assure you, the two are quite unique.

<p>
Adasi is essentially just the Persian spin on Lentil Soup, and it&rsquo;s not something I liked very much growing up. I found the taste to be acceptable, but it was more so the combination with little lentils you have to chew on and
the liquid of the soup that made it unbearable for me. <i>Texture is important, man, what can I say?</i> When we tried it earlier last year in Food and Nutrition class, funnily enough actually, I discovered that I like it now. I hope
you&rsquo;ll like this recipe just the same!

<li><i>4h</i> prior to cooking the Adasi, leave your Lentils in a bowl of room temperature water so they absorb it and grow big and strong</li>
<li>Pour your tasty little Lentil children into a pot in some water, and apply Medium Heat! Chop your Potato into semi-thick slices, and when the Lentils are half cooked, add them to the pot</li>
<li>Chop up the Onions then stir-fry them in a pan (you can do this above a separate source of heat as the pot, but for the sake of convenience I&rsquo;d highly recommend this new handy dandy invention I came across in the Flea Market a few weeks ago called the <i>Stove</i>) with some Oil and Turmeric. Finally, add a dash of Cinnamon (don&rsquo;t) to the Onions</li>
<li>After your Potatoes have fully baked, remove around half of them from the pot and mash them. Now, add the mashed potatoes to your Onions. Stir it up, and finally add the whole thing to your still cooking Lentils</li>
<li>Add some salt and pepper, and let it cook for ten more minutes.</li>

Haleem is a dish that always seemed to me like it would be delicious, but I was always also skittish at the thought of there being Lamb inside of a soup which is so obviously supposed to be sweet. I also mixed it up with <a href="#org47d6efd">Halva</a>
during the making of this Cookbook so that&rsquo;s nice. It isn&rsquo;t something I&rsquo;ve had <i>yet,</i> but I&rsquo;m hoping that&rsquo;ll change someday rather soon!

<p>
Adas Polo is an absolute classic for me. It&rsquo;s what I would have for lunch essentially at least once a week, and I still eat it very often! I like my Adas Polo rather plain, but well, what can I say? I happen to still have a
portion of my sanity left. Raisins, dates, and Walnuts have <i>no place</i> in Adas Polo in my opinion. Regardless, Adas Polo is a dish that can be made as a lunch for a common day, or to treat an entire party. Whatever the case, it&rsquo;s
always delicious!

<li>Wash your raisins - if you decided to use raisins - and pat them dry on Kitchen Paper</li>
<li>Add your lentils to a saucepan, with a ratio of 3 cups of water for every 1 cup of lentils. Bring this to a boil and then apply a very tight cover, and reduce the heat to simmer it until the Lentils are tender. This should take <i>about 15-20m.</i> Set them aside once you are done</li>
<li>Heat up your Vegetable Oil in a large pan, and begin frying your Onion until the pieces turn golden. Now add the Ground Beef and cook until that turns light brown.

Now, set this aside for later use</li>
<li>Pour 6 cups of water into a large nonstick pot and bring it to a boil. Add rice into the pot, and after <i>6-8m,</i> once it begins to rise to the top and the water begins boiling again, check the rice is cooked by trying a grain. Finally, pour the rice into a Colander to drain it; then set it aside.</li>
<li>Scoop 1/3 of the rice into a pot. Layer it with 1/3 of the cooked Lentils, and repeat until it&rsquo;s all in there, then shape it into a pyramid. Add 3 tbsps of your bloomed Saffron to this pot. Cover the pot and cook it until the rice begins to steam; <i>about 30-40m</i></li>

Loobia Polo is one of my favourites for sure. It&rsquo;s probably a weird sounding meal to anyone looking in from the outside; with the fact it contains Green Beans stuffed with Ground Beef/Lamb typically, but I assure you it does not
disappoint! It&rsquo;s absolutely delectable to enjoy with some Plain or Greek Yogurt as well, as you&rsquo;re about to see.

<p>
Gheimeh is a dish which means a lot to me; even when I don&rsquo;t like it very much. I have incredibly fond memories of staying at my Grandparents&rsquo; house with my younger Cousin, and stealing a few Fries fresh off the pan as my Grandma
pretended to be upset with us all the while finding it to be the most adorable thing. I always loved the Fries, never the khoresh. Quite picky I know, but it&rsquo;s how I liked it. What&rsquo;s more is that some days, after Kindergarten, my
Uncle would pick me up when my mom couldn&rsquo;t and we&rsquo;d go to this little Burger restaurant around the corner of my home where he&rsquo;d treat me to some Fries. Over the years, I have grown a love for the flavour of Gheimeh too, and
above most of these dishes, this is the one that reminds me the most of Iran, and of my family. I miss those simpler days absconding away with a handful of Fries alongside my Cousin as my Grandma cooked. I miss her a lot more
than I ever got the chance to say in the end. I find it really interesting how food is one of the key things that gets passed down across generations most triumphantly. There is truth to the idea that food tells a story, and in
many ways it&rsquo;s what <i>represents</i> you. I hope you find your own scoop of bliss in what represents me.

<p>
Aush Restheh is most definitely not among my favourite of the Persian dishes. Most people would likely fight me on this, but eating it on occasion back in Iran, I couldn&rsquo;t help but be appalled by it&rsquo;s viscosity, smell, and look
so much that I never got to the taste. It&rsquo;s a very festive dish in our culture; due to the large quantities yielded from an average bowl of Aush, as well as the amount of time one needs to simply let it sit and brew over heat,
it would be reserved only for the most special nights to be enjoyed with many, many friends and family. It isn&rsquo;t something I&rsquo;ve eaten in a number of years&#x2026; I&rsquo;d like to give it another try someday. I&rsquo;m curious to see if I still
feel so opposed to it.

<li>Transport your Chickpeas and Kidney Beans into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water. Now, simply place the container on a counter because you are now going to let this stand for 8 hours overnight.</li>
<li>Heat 1 tbsp of Olive Oil in a skillet over medium heat, then spread your chunks of red onions in and stir. Continue stirring until the onions turns translucent; <i>about 5m.</i> Now, reduce the heat to low and continue stirring until your Onions caramelize into little tender golden brown chunks; <i>about 40m.</i> Now stir in your dried mint, and continue cooking until the Onions begin turning dark brown and crisp; <i>about 15m.</i> Once done, set this aside to be used later as garnish.</li>
<li>Heat your remaining Olive Oil in a stock pot. Now, you&rsquo;ll stir in the Yellow Onions, and continue doing so until the Onions have turned translucent; <i>about 5m.</i> Add some minced garlic in, and stir until you can smell that decidedly not-so-fantastic fragrant; <i>about 1m.</i> Stir in some more Chickpeas, kidney beans, and include some turmeric now; toss your pot to combine everything.

<li>Stir some Parsley, Cilantro, Mint (ew), Scallions, and Lentils into your soup.

<li>Stir 1/2 of your Spinach into the Soup until it has wilted; <i>about 1m.</i> Now, add in the remaining Spinach and allow this to simmer for <i>30 minutes,</i> occasionally stirring some more. (Yeah, I know, lots and lots of stirring.)</li>
<li>Stir some flour alongside 3 tbsps of the soup together inside a small bowl until smooth. Now, re-introduce the flour back into your soup, and continue to simmer it over low heat, making sure to frequently stir the pot, until it has thickened; <i>about 30m.</i></li>

</div>

<p>
What is there that I could hope to accomplish by speaking about Tahchin? My main memories of it were all during uncomfortably large Mehmoonies always strangely hosted at some Uncle or Aunt&rsquo;s house where all the lights were
always disorientingly warm for my little 5 year old eyes. If you want to know what Mehmoonies are, they&rsquo;re Persian almost-parties featuring relatives that are distant to you, but just barely not distant enough for it to still be
expected of you to know them and have memories of them from when you were 3. Key staples of Mehmoonies include somehow shiny wooden furniture, a minimum of 2 Persian rugs in every room, the confusingly pleasant smell of smoke,
Uncles with either completely white hair and a comically large moustache, or no hair whatsoever, the expectancy of staying until 2:00 in the morning, several dozen goodbyes out the door and from your car when it turns out you
don&rsquo;t have the stomach to stay until 2:00 in the morning, and of course, a large dinner plate of incredibly dry food. <i>Ahhh</i> culture. Tahchin was always a welcome addition to these ensembles, of course; notoriously difficult to
make as it is. I&rsquo;ve always liked the crunchy layer of rice, actually; it&rsquo;s quite unique. I think you may too, reader.

<h4 id="orgb3c1495">Directions</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb3c1495">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Soak your Barberries in water for <i>1h</i> (or skip this step if you&rsquo;re not using Barberries like a decent member of society)</li>
<li>Cut your onion into small chunks, and begin cooking with the Chicken, as well as 1 glass of water, salt, pepper, and turmeric on gentle heat until the water fully evaporates. Make sure to then cut the chicken into small bite-sized pieces</li>
<li>Rinse your rice until the water runs clear. Next, pour it into a large pan filled with water, and add some salt and cook for <i>6-8m.</i> It&rsquo;ll begin to rise to the top and the water will begin to boil. Once this happens, check that the rice is cooked by trying a grain. The rice should be soft on the outside, yet still firm in the middle. Once this is the case, pour it into a colander to drain, and set it aside</li>
<li>Mix your plain Yogurt, Egg yolks, and bloomed Saffron in a bowl</li>
<li>Add 1/2 of your rice into the Yogurt mixture and begin whisking by hand</li>
<li>Add 3 tbsps of Oil to your rice cooker or a pan</li>
<li>Pour half of the Saffron-rice into this pan. Flatten the first layer with a spoon, and add a layer of chicken pieces, then cover the entire surface with your remaining plain rice</li>
<li>Pour your remaining liquid Saffron over the rice. Alternatively, you could use Oil or melted butter</li>
<li>Put your pot on medium-high heat, and cover it, leaving it to cook until the rice begins to steam. Lower the heat and cook for <i>1h</i> until a crust begins to form</li>
<li>Serve on a large plate; Tahchin can usually be cut into slices like a cake, most optimally</li>

<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>Now here&rsquo;s some really good stuff! Skewers of Kebab Koobideh served with buttery rice, a grilled tomato, and some onions</p>
</div>

<p>
This is (just slightly arguably) my favourite dish in the world. Kebab Koobideh is, in truth, quite a simple food: Skewers of Lamb or Beef pounded onto the metal rods and grilled over an open fire, then served either with thin
bread or buttery rice. I like it with rice most of all, and I&rsquo;ve found that adding some Sumac and a Sunny-Side up egg over it really completes it. This is one food I have the absolute fondest memories of from Iran. I&rsquo;ve been to
parties where we&rsquo;ve had Skewers of Kebab grilled over a bonfire, and I&rsquo;ve been to incredibly stylish restaurants in cities whose names I can&rsquo;t even recall with such fatty, flavourful Kebab that it&rsquo;s to die for much of the time.
There are some smaller restaurants in Toronto that try to replicate that, but I haven&rsquo;t found anything that compares to the flavour I remember from back in Iran. I don&rsquo;t just say that to pump you up either, dear reader; hopefully
there will come better days with a better Government over there where it&rsquo;ll be open for all to safely visit once more. If that does happen, and you feel compelled to go explore the country, this is one food you&rsquo;d be kidding
yourself by skipping.

Kotlet is most certainly a comfort food of mine. This must&rsquo;ve been one of the first foods I ever ate, and I&rsquo;m still an avid fan of it. They&rsquo;re this little potato and meat patties and they&rsquo;re moist but structured, they contain all
my favourite flavours, and they can easily be served with Rice, as patties to a sandwich, or even all on their own on platters in parties. (Though do note they&rsquo;re typically too messy to be &rsquo;finger food&rsquo;)

Sholezard is one of few recipes in this Cookbook which I have little experience with. It&rsquo;s one I have faint memories of seeing my relatives eat in early mornings in cars during road trips through the mountain clearings, but it&rsquo;s
not one I ever tasted for myself; likely because I found the appearance to be off-putting and that matters an unfortunate amount in relation to food when you&rsquo;re young. It&rsquo;s a rice pudding which heavily features the use of Saffron
and so it is my belief that you&rsquo;ll find it to be a very rich kind of sweet. A sort of rock candy kind of sweet, perhaps; though that&rsquo;s just my brain&rsquo;s way of interpreting it. Let&rsquo;s find out together, shall we my most enlightened

Halva is the single food in this menu which my opinion has changed about in the most jarring manner. It&rsquo;s a thick, sweet sort of dessert which I found to be rather <i>sickeningly sweet</i> when I was younger, but I absolutely love Halva
alongside a cup of tea nowadays. It&rsquo;s really a perfect representation of Persian desserts I&rsquo;d say. Sweet, savoury, and perfect with a cup of tea.

<p>
Ranginak is a dessert I&rsquo;ve never personally tasted before, but I have seen it a lot on display in little Bakeries every now and then. I always preferred the fudge chocolate things instead, and they were always a viable alternative
so I never got the chance to taste Ranginaks. I don&rsquo;t imagine they&rsquo;d be the tastiest since I really dislike Dates but it&rsquo;s also been a long time since I&rsquo;ve had them.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>4 cups</b> pitted Mejdool Dates (about 30 of them, therefore; if you&rsquo;ve never had Dates before&#x2026; I&rsquo;m so sorry in advance)</li>
<li><b>1.5 cups</b> Walnuts; broken into large pieces</li>
<li><b>1 cup</b> Unsalted Butter</li>
<li><b>1.75 cups</b> All-Purpose-Flour</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9947561">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Apply butter to a 10-inch Pie Plate and line it with 3 parchment paper strips so as to extend over the edge of the pan. Be sure to apply Butter in between the strips</li>
<li>Heat a Cast-Iron Skillet at medium heat and toast some Walnuts for <i>about 5m.</i> Set it aside to cool</li>
<li>Pack the pitted Dates with Walnut pieces and arrange it in the Pie Plate. Press down on the soft dates to fill any large gaps</li>
<li>Melt butter in the Skillet ad medium heat, and add flour whilst toasting it lightly. Stir continuously for <i>about 15-20m</i> until the flour takes on a spreadable consistency</li>
<li>Pour the flour-butter mixture immediately over your Dates. Using a spatula, spread it evenly and pack it into the date layer</li>
<li>Combine Powdered Sugar, Ground Cinnamon, Ground Cardamom, and sift it evenly over the dough mixture</li>
<li>Sprinkle Ground Pistachios in an even layer over the Sugar and press it down lightly</li>
<li>Cover, and set it overnight at room temperature. If desired, you can sift Powdered Sugar and/or cocoa powder in decorative patterns over the Pistachio Layer</li>
<li>Run a knife around the dessert to loosen it from the pan. Then, use the parchment paper to transfer it to a cutting board and cut it into pieces</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>

<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>A plate of Khagineh made in the decidedly less Tabrizi way. Looks like an Apple Pie, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
</div>

<p>
Khagineh is one of few dishes I have <i>absolutely no</i> experience with inside this Cookbook. It&rsquo;s a dish that originated in Azerbaijan and is more popular amongst the folk in Tabriz, which somewhat explains my unfamiliarity with it
since I&rsquo;m a <i>hip and cool</i> Tehran fellow myself. Just from the Ingredients list and pictures it looks mighty delicious, however!

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Pour your eggs into a bowl and add the Yogurt. Stir them until they&rsquo;re completely mixed, then add Baking Powder and Flour, and continue stirring</li>
<li>Add oil to a pot, and once the Oil goes hot, lower the heat. Pour the ingredients from the bowl into the pot and cover it for <i>20m.</i> Ond side of the Khagineh must be fried during this time, so flip it to fry the other side. <b>It may be easier to use a heat diffuser for this.</b></li>
<li>Take it out of the pot, cut into pieces, and serve with some Syrup of your choice</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
